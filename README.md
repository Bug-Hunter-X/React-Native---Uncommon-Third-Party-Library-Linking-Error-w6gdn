# React Native Uncommon Third-Party Library Linking Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet sometimes difficult-to-diagnose issue in React Native: linking errors with third-party libraries. The error occurs when the native modules of a library fail to integrate correctly with your React Native application.

## The Problem

The example code illustrates a scenario where a hypothetical library ('react-native-uncommon-lib') is not properly linked. This might lead to runtime crashes, unexpected behavior, or build failures.

## The Solution

The solution file shows how to correctly link the library using the appropriate methods based on your platform (Android and iOS).  Proper steps include verifying library installation, ensuring correct dependencies are set, and running linking commands if required.

This repository is for illustrative purposes; the specific library and linking procedures will depend on the third-party library you are using.  Always refer to the library's documentation for the most accurate linking instructions.
