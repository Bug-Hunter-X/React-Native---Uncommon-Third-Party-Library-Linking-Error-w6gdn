This error occurs when using a third-party library or native module that is not properly linked or configured within your React Native project. It can manifest in various ways, such as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build errors.  The specific symptoms depend on the library and the nature of the linking issue. For example, you might see errors related to missing modules, undefined symbols, or runtime exceptions.  One common scenario is when you're using a library that requires native code (e.g., written in Objective-C or Java) and the bridge between the native code and your JavaScript code isn't properly established.
