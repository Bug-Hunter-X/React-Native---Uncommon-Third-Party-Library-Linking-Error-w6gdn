The solution involves verifying the library installation and following the specific linking instructions provided by the library's documentation.  For example, you might need to run commands like `react-native link` or manually configure the native project files (Android's `android/app/build.gradle` and `settings.gradle`, or iOS's Xcode project files).  Double-check your package.json to ensure that the library is correctly listed as a dependency, and that the version is compatible with your React Native version. If the library requires specific native configurations, ensure that these are properly done.  Cleaning and rebuilding the project often resolves transient linking issues. In extreme cases, removing and reinstalling the library might be necessary.
